                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">Buses are the electrical highways that carry all the information around your computer. Without them, the CPU couldn't communicate with RAM or anything else! Let's explore the three types of buses.</p>

                        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2 text-rose-600">📍 Address Bus</h3>
                        <p class="text-stone-700">This is a <strong>one-way</strong> street from the CPU to RAM. Think of it as a delivery truck that only carries one thing: a memory address (the specific location of data). The width of this bus determines how much RAM your system can access, because a wider bus can carry a bigger "number" (address). For example, a 32-bit address bus can access $2^{32}$ unique locations, or about 4 GB.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700">This is a <strong>two-way</strong> highway for the actual payload: the data! Whether the CPU is reading information from RAM or sending new information to be stored, it travels along the data bus. The wider this bus is, the more data can be moved at once, leading to a faster overall system.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700">The control bus is the nervous system, a <strong>two-way</strong> street carrying all the command and status signals. When the CPU needs to read from memory, the Control Unit sends a signal on this bus. When a component is ready, it sends a signal back. This bus ensures perfect timing and coordination.</p>

                <p class="text-lg text-stone-600 max-w-3xl mx-auto">This is a common misconception! It's not about having more chefs in the kitchen; it's about whether the recipe can be split up. This section compares different processor types and shows you what they're best at.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700">A <strong>single-core</strong> CPU has one processing unit and can only handle one instruction at a time. It's like a person who can only do one task at a time, no matter how fast they are. While simple and efficient for non-demanding applications, they struggle with multitasking as they must quickly switch between tasks.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700">A <strong>multi-core</strong> CPU has two or more cores on a single chip, allowing it to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. This is ideal for multitasking and demanding applications, but the performance gain depends on whether the software is optimized for parallel processing. It's the key to modern multitasking!</p>
                        <h4 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4 text-rose-500">The Power of Pipelining (HL Extension)</h4>
                        <p class="text-stone-600">Modern multi-core CPUs use <strong>pipelining</strong>, a technique where the CPU starts working on the next instruction (fetching) before the current one is finished (executing). It's like an assembly line: one worker can be adding a wheel to a car while another is painting the car that came before it. This allows for a huge increase in throughput and efficiency.</p>

                        <p class="text-stone-700">A <strong>co-processor</strong> is a specialized chip that assists the main CPU by offloading specific, repetitive tasks. A <strong>GPU</strong> is a prime example, with thousands of small cores optimized for tasks like rendering graphics and machine learning, which involve performing the same operation on massive datasets. They're amazing at parallel tasks, making your games and videos look incredible!</p>
